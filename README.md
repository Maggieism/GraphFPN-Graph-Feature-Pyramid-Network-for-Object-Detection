Download graph-FPN-main.zip \
then you can run: \
sh train.sh \
get the result of graphFPN \
it is a simple version. However, it includes all codes of our graph FPN. you can adjust the following code based on it \
Download graph-mmdet.zip \
this code uses mmdetecion as the base framework \
you can set yourself env based on mmdetection \
this can simply run: sh train.sh to get the result of CGL-1 in graphFPN, thus, you should add other components from the above codes to run the complete two-stage GraphFPN.
